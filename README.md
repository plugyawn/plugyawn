### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning multi-output Gaussian Process regressors for an upcoming paper with Prof. Nipun Batra at IIT Gandhinagar, in neural radiance fields, and generative models.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on portfolio optimization with Mudrex Capital, a young hedge-fund, and with Dr. Navneet Bung at TCS Research, for generating peptide sequences with antimicrobial properties.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects on computer vision, natural language processing, finance, and (especially) probabilistic machine learning.
- 📫 Reach me at progyan.das@iitgn.ac.in, visit my website (progyan.me), or text me at +91 60098 84968!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm visiting Caltech in the coming summer as a research intern under Prof. Ashish Mahabal, as part of their SURF programme!
