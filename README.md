### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on portfolio optimization with Mudrex Capital, a young hedge-fund, and with Dr. Navneet Bung at TCS Research, for generating peptide sequences with antimicrobial properties. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning multi-output Gaussian Process regressors for an upcoming paper, neural radiance fields, and generative models.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects on computer vision, natural language processing, finance, and (especially) probabilistic machine learning.
- ðŸ“« Reach me at progyan.das@iitgn.ac.in, visit my website (progyan.me), or text me at +91 60098 84968!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm visiting Caltech in the coming summer as a research intern under Prof. Ashish Mahabal, as part of their SURF programme!
