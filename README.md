### Hi, I'm Progyan!

I am a Machine Learning researcher, and I'll be joining as an Applied Scientist at Microsoft Bangalore soon! You may know me as `plugyawn`, which is what I identify as online. Either way, this is my slice of the internet, so here’s a little bit about me.

I’m intrigued by Theoretical Deep Learning, Probabilistic Machine Learning and Differential Equations (especially in Operator Learning). My research is aligned along those fields.

I’ve been part of the Google Summer of Code, I am a Cargill Global Scholar, and I’ve also serving as the Overall Technical Secretary at IIT Gandhinagar, overseeing all technical activities that occur here at the student level. I also spent a wonderful summer in sunny California as a Caltech SURF fellow in the summer of 2023.

If you see me on the streets of Bangalore some time, do say hi – first chai’s on me.
